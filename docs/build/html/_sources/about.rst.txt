About
=====================================
MassBalanceCal collects mass balance algorithms for petrology in general, with MCMC for propagating errors on phases and bulk compositions, including:

Non-negative least square algorithm

Matrix decomposition algorithm of Li et al. (2020).

Algorithm of Albarede and Provost (1977) (future update)
