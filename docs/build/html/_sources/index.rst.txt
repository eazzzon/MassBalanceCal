DATA PREPARATION
##################

1. Load your phase compositions in the ``input excel files``, use sheets store different phases, free to change sheet names and orders **BUT NOT** ``bulk`` and ``run_index`` sheets (they should always stay as the last two), ``bulk`` sheet should give the bulk composition(s), ``run_index`` should give the entire experimental run numbers Â± expts conditions, sample numbers or rock ids for natural samples, which are then used for indexing and matching during calculation.

2. If you only have one bulk composition, you can use `input_comp_oneBulk.xlsx`, or `input_comp.xlsx` but overwrite the bulk sheet.

3. If you change the element in the header, you should also change the definition of element list in the script for consistency.

4. If you didn't install the module, **DO NOT** change the structure of the directory.
